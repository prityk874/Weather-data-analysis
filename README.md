📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Science journey, where I explored and analyzed a Weather Dataset using Python. 
The goal was to answer real-world questions and extract meaningful insights by applying data analysis techniques.

1.Key Insights from the Analysis:
-Discovered unique wind speed values across the dataset
-Identified how often the weather was exactly Clear ☀️
-Found all instances when Snowfall was recorded ❄️
-Calculated the mean visibility and standard deviation of pressure
-Extracted complex conditions such as:Wind speed > 24 km/h & visibility = 25 km
Weather being Clear with humidity > 50%

2.Tech Stack Used:
Python
Libraries: Pandas.
Techniques:
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Data Cleaning & Transformation
-Statistical Analysis
3.Learnings:
-Handling missing values and renaming columns efficiently
-Applying groupby operations for statistical insights
-Writing conditional queries to filter scenarios
-Translating business-like questions into data-driven solutions
